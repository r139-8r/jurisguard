## Privacy & Security (JurisGuard Protocols)
- **Data Sanitization**: Documents are treated strictly as data, with safeguards against prompt injection and tampering.
- **PII Protection**: Automatically redacts or anonymizes personal identifiers (names, addresses, phone numbers) during analysis. Output uses generic terms like "The Client" or "Party A".
- **Evidence-Based Output**: Every flagged risk must include a direct, verbatim quote from the original text.
- **User Ownership**: Documents are protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), accessible only by the uploader.
- **No Legal Advice**: JurisGuard is a risk assessor, not a lawyer. All output is for informational purposes only.
